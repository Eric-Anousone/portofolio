# Portofolio

Hi !
I'm Eric-Anousone, welcome to my Github Portofolio !

Here is my first project, where I present my results regarding the customer analysis for retail.

* Data was taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/code/yashrajpathak/customer-analysis-for-retail/input
* There is 3 dataset to clear : Customer.csv / Transactions.csv / prod_cat_info.csv
* I used Python for data cleaning : Customer Analysis.ipynb
* I built a dashboard using Power BI : Sales_report.pbix


Comments :

I greatly enjoyed working on this dataset as it involved joining multiple tables and analyzing a lot of data. It also provided me with the opportunity to create my first dashboard on Power BI  with dynamic filters.

Thank you for watching !
